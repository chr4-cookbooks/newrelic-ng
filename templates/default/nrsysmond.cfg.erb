# New Relic Server Monitor configuration file.
#
# Lines that begin with a # are comment lines and are ignored by the server
# monitor. For those options that have command line equivalents, if the
# option is specified on the command line it will over-ride any value set
# in this file.
#

#
# Option : license_key
# Value  : 40-character hexadecimal string provided by New Relic. This is
#          required in order for the server monitor to start.
# Default: none
#
license_key=<%= @license_key %>

# Option : hostname
# Value  : Hostname to display in the New Relic web frontend
# Default: System hostname
#
<% if @hostname %>
hostname=<%= @hostname %>
<% end -%>

#
# Option : loglevel
# Value  : Level of detail you want in the log file (as defined by the logfile
#          setting below. Valid values are (in increasing levels of verbosity):
#          error        - show errors only
#          warning      - show errors and warnings
#          info         - show minimal additional information messages
#          verbose      - show more detailed information messages
#          debug        - show debug messages
#          verbosedebug - show very detailed debug messages
# Default: error
# Note   : Can also be set with the -d command line option.
#
loglevel=<%= @loglevel %>

#
# Option : logfile
# Value  : Name of the file where the server monitor will store it's log
#          messages. The amount of detail stored in this file is controlled
#          by the loglevel option (above).
# Default: none. However it is highly recommended you set a value for this.
# Note   : Can also be set with the -l command line option.
#
logfile=<%= @logfile %>

#
# Option : proxy
# Value  : The name and optional login credentials of the proxy server to use
#          for all communication with the New Relic collector. In its simplest
#          form this setting is just a hostname[:port] setting. The default
#          port if none is specified is 1080. If your proxy requires a user
#          name, use the syntax user@host[:port]. If it also requires a
#          password use the format user:password@host[:port]. For example:
#            fred:secret@proxy.mydomain.com:8181
# Default: none (use a direct connection)
#
<% if @proxy %>
proxy=<%= @proxy %>
<% end -%>

# Setting: ssl
# Type   : boolean
# Purpose: If you prefer the daemon to use the secure HTTP (https) protocol
#          when communicating with the New Relic collector servers, set this
#          to true.
# Default: true (as of version 1.4)
#
ssl=<%= @ssl.to_s %>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_bundle
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM
#          format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used
#          to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If ssl_ca_path
#          is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be
#          searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the
#          ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl
#          is set to false.
# Default: none
#
<% if @ssl_ca_bundle %>
ssl_ca_bundle=<%= @ssl_ca_bundle %>
<% end -%>

# Setting: ssl_ca_path
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates
#          in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be
#          used to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If
#          ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first
#          followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This
#          setting has no effect when ssl is set to false.
# Default: none
#
<% if @ssl_ca_path %>
ssl_ca_path=<%= @ssl_ca_path %>
<% end -%>

#
# Option : pidfile
# Value  : Name of a file where the server monitoring daemon will store it's
#          process ID (PID). This is used by the startup and shutdown script
#          to determine if the monitor is already running, and to start it up
#          or shut it down.
# Default: /tmp/nrsysmond.pid
# Note   : Can also be set with the -p command line option.
#
<% if @pidfile %>
pidfile=<%= @pidfile %>
<% end -%>

#
# Option : collector_host
# Value  : The name of the New Relic collector to connect to. This should only
#          ever be changed on advise from a New Relic support staff member.
#          The format is host[:port]. Using a port number of 0 means the default
#          port, which is 80 (if not using the ssl option - see below) or 443
#          if SSL is enabled. If the port is omitted the default value is used.
# Default: collector.newrelic.com
#
<% if @collector_host %>
collector_host=<%= @collector_host %>
<% end -%>

#
# Option : timeout
# Value  : How long the monitor should wait to contact the collector host. If
#          the connection cannot be established in this period of time, the
#          monitor will progressively back off in 15-second increments, up to
#          a maximum of 300 seconds. Once the initial connection has been
#          established, this value is reset back to the value specified here
#          (or the default). This then sets the maximum time to wait for
#          a connection to the collector to report data. There is no back-off
#          once the original connection has been made. The value is in seconds.
# Default: 30
#
